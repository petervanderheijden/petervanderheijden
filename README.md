# 👋 Hey
My name is Peter. I am sixtheen years old and I am from the Netherlands. I liked programming since I was a kid, I just didn't know back then. Now my goal is to become a full-stack developer. I am currently working on my JavaScript skills but my goals after that are to learn React and Python. The thing I like most to do with JavaScript is creating Discord Bots. I am also very creative so I learned myself apps like Photoshop (which i of course paid for lol) and Davinci Resolve.

NOTE: A lot of my projects here on GitHub are unfinished or discontinued, you know how it is.
